<img src="website-assets/icon.svg" width=80 align="right">

This is a basic Android app, which loads [the website of SIS CUNI](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/) (using [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html)) and injects custom styles and scripts to make the website more mobile- and user-friendly.

This app does NOT collect usernames, passwords, personal information or any other data.

*Note: Some things may be hidden or not work.*

## Screenshots

*Note: The elements that appear cut off in the screenshots are, in fact, horizontally scrollable. \
(Czech version is shown, but switching to English is possible.)*

## Download

OR:

Download the APK file from [Releases](https://github.com/sykoram/sis/releases) &rarr; Assets &rarr; app-release.apk. 

To install it, "Install apps from unknown/external sources" option has to be enabled in your Android. This option should be found somewhere in settings. You can try: \
"Settings &rarr; Apps & notifications &rarr; Special app access &rarr; Install unknown apps" \
"Settings &rarr; Security &rarr; Unknown sources"

Open the downloaded APK file and you should be able to install it. You might see a "Blocked by Play Protect" message, because I'm not a verified developer and the app is not being installed from Google Play.
