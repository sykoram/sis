# SIS

This is a basic Android app, which loads [the website of SIS CUNI](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/) (using [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html)) and injects custom styles and scripts to make the website more mobile- and user-friendly.

This app does NOT collect usernames, passwords, personal information or any other data.

Note: Some things may be hidden or not work.

## Screenshots

The appearence may change over time, but I'll try to update these screenshots.

*Note: Some of the elements appear cut off in the screenshots, but they are, in fact, horizontally scrollable. \
(Czech version is shown, but switching to English is possible.)*
